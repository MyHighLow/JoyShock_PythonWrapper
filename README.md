# JoyShock_PythonWrapper
Python Wrapper for the JibbSmart's [JoyShock Library](https://github.com/JibbSmart/JoyShockLibrary)

## Concept
The JoyShock C++ library provides a way to interface Nintendo Switch JoyCon and PlayStation DualShock game controllers, emphasizing their precise motion control capabilities. This project is intended to make the JoyShock library accessible as a python module. Currently provides basic functionality, but is still a work in progress.
